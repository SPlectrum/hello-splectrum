# hello-splectrum

The initial POC implementing the request context and flow for some simple Hello World type functionality.

---
Here are some initial ideas - but need to restructure and correct them.

Setting up and testing an initial execution context and request execution flow.  
Thinking of doing it using bash and inotify or with javascript filewatch - no decision made yet.

The aim of the Hello Splectrum example is to set up a simple folder based stream example that processes a request.  
It should process using a consumer publisher pattern and acts as validation of an initial approach which then can be reused.

It will also involve having initial thoughts about runtime etc.
and an analysis of the record structure used for the implementation.
